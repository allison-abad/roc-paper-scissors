## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** 
*HTML 
*CSS
*JavaScript
*Node

I ran npm install in the terminal to download node modules, then ran Node server.js in terminal.
Used HTML to hold content of button and result messages.
CSS used to style layout.

## What I learned 
I learned how to apply nodemon to restart server automatically rather then having to refresh and run through the terminal everytime a change is being made to files.
